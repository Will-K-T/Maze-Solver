# Maze Solver
This is a Java program that creates and solves a random maze. I created this project as a way to explore both depth and breadth first searches. The program starts by displaying a new maze as it starts to solve it with depth-first; once it solves the maze with depth-first, it moves on to breadth-first. Once both have finished, it displays the shortest path! For the graphics, I used the STD library for Java.

The first image shows the program solving the maze with a depth-first approach. The depth-first path is shown as the rainbow colored path.

The second image shows the program solving the maze with a breadth-first approach. The breadth-first path is shown as the black colored path that slowly spreads out and fills the entire board.

This final image shows the fastest path through the maze. The fastest path is shown as the rainbow colored path against the black background. Something interesting to note is that the depth-first and breadth-first solution will always be the same since the maze only has one solution!
